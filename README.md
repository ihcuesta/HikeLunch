<b>What is Hikeat?</b>
<br/><br/>
Hikeat is a web application that connect mountain village restaurants with lovers of hiking. The website offers daily plans that start at the restaurant organizer of the plan, which offers breakfast and advice on the hiking trail. Later, the hikers go hiking and return to the restaurant to have lunch.

The underlying idea is to encourage ecotourism and offer to local restaurants in mountain towns a tool to get more guests.

<b>Technology</b>
<br/><br/>
Hikeat is a responsive MERN Stack application: backend on Node.js with Express.js framework, database on Mongo DB Atlas and frontend on React.

It uses several components of the Material UI library, designed expressly for React and based on the design principles of Material Design. It also uses the package Styled Components to, if we may say so again, style components.

Hikeat's maps are built on the Leaflet library, which uses Open Street Maps; in combination with the API REST Here, which allows the conversion of postal addresses to geographic coordinates.
