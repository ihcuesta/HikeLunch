<b>What is Hikeat?</b>
  
Hikeat is a web application that connect mountain village restaurants with lovers of hiking. The website offers daily plans that start at the restaurant organizer of the plan, which offers breakfast and advice on the hiking trail. Later, the hikers go hiking and return to the restaurant to have lunch.

The underlying idea is to encourage ecotourism and offer to local restaurants in mountain towns a tool to get more guests.
